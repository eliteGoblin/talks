* About myself

My major interet are among building microservice using Golang, cloud architecture, distributed system.

I am good at writing clean, well tested code; data structure design, object oriented programing. 

I also like reading tech books, some of them are: AWS in action, Kuternetes in action, Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices, Concurrency in Go, Cryptography for Dummies, the docker book, prometheus up and running, Advanced Programming in Unix Environment, etc; non-tech books like: flow, deep working, micro habbits.

* Knowledge sharing/mentoring

Read book, write blogs, brownbag sessions:

- Go Project Layout - Clean Architecture
- Microservice Monitoring
- Concurrency in Go
- Error propagation in Go
- Log Tracing in Go
- ORM or NoORM
- Cache solution suggestion: dynamodb

* System Debugging

- Broken connection pool
- Unstable freeswitch
- Service deadlock: acd, cti main event distributor hang
- Memory leakage: http client body, robot cache

I've read part of book(CPU, ):

* Major Projects

* Call center microservice

- 25,000 sip phones registered, over 300k calls made daily

.image images/call_center.png

* Call center microservice: Version 1

.image images/version_1.png

* Call center microservice: Version 2

.image images/API_GATEWAY.png _ 800

* Call center microservice: Version 2

- Multiple instance of CTI, ACD, ADS, Freeswitch..
- Effort to make CTI stateless: store sip phone state to redis

* CTI SIP phone managment module

.image images/sip_management.png

* Implement FSM to agency state

.image images/acd_revised.png _ 400

* ADS's priority queue for multi-task

.image images/ads_priority.png _ 600

* Faq robot cache sharding

- 700k queries daily
- Enable route different companies to seperate nodes
- Node liveness detection

.image images/robot_sharding.png

* ADS forcast module

- Implement Forecast formula 
- Based on past 30 minutes data
- Layered, msg based system
- 2500+ lines, over 90% coverage, no bugs found 

.image images/ads_forcast.png _ 400

* Private cloud automation 

.image images/private_cloud_automation.png

Implement cross cutting functions: error propagation, log tracing, metric interface

* Interests, plan

- Distributed system
- AWS certificate
- Service mesh
- Keep writing blogs...

* Machine learning 

I took Dr Andrew Ng's machine learning course:
